# Dolphy üê¨
Dolphy is an innovative healthcare platform inspired by the dolphin, symbolizing health and well-being in various cultures. It leverages advanced technologies to provide personalized disease prediction and precautionary advice.

## Overview üöÄ
Dolphy integrates MindsDB for machine learning model creation and training. Users input symptoms, and Dolphy sends these to a MindsDB model(stored in DOCKER) to deliver accurate disease predictions and precautionary measures. An integrated AI agent powered by Google Gemini provides tailored precautions for identified diseases.

## Features ‚ú®
1. Disease Prediction: Users input symptoms to receive precise disease predictions.
2. Precautionary Advice: Integrated AI agent powered by Google Gemini provides tailored precautions for identified diseases.
3. Technological Stack: Flask serves as the robust backend server, handling data processing and model inference, while React offers a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## Future Enhancements üåü
1. Advanced AI Integration: Plan to replace Google Gemini with a chatbot trained on MindsDB using LangChain and OpenAI GPT-4 for enhanced interaction and intelligent responses.
2. Enhanced User Experience: Implement features like image recognition and voice input for seamless user interaction and accessibility.

### Quick Insights üëä

The Current Project uses Gemini-pro for text generation. Prompt Engineering is done to provide clear cut precautions for each disease.
